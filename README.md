# Python ML Project One

## Introduction

In this project, I load MNIST data into python then run various classifiers against the training and test data sets, drawing conclusions regarding the prediction accuracy of each classifier. More information can be found in the Project Report PDF.

## Files In This Directory:

- ProjectOneReport.pdf: PDF of final project report
- naive_bayesian.py: Python file containing source code for naive bayesian classifier
- nearest_neighbors.py: Python file containing source code for nearest neighbors classifier
- lda.py: Python file containing source code for LDA classifier
- pca.py: Python file containing source code for PCA classifier
- versions.py: [IGNORE] Python file used to test importing libraries
- load_mnist.py: [IGNORE] Python file used to test loading/formatting MNIST data

## How To Run Code:

1. Follow instructions on this website to set up proper Python ML environment and dependencies.
   (https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/)
2. Open up terminal and run "python3 filename.py" and it should display all the desired output.
3. NOTE: if the code doesn't run due to invalid import statements, check which virtual environment you're on.
   Also, try using a separate terminal window instead of VSCode/PyCharm integrated terminal.
